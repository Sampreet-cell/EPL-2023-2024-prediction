# English Premier League 2023-24 Prediction
This prediction model utilizes the Poisson distribution in MS Excel to forecast match outcomes and predict the final standings of the Premier League for the 2023-24 season.

# Overview
The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that can be used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. In the context of football, it can be used to estimate the number of goals scored by a team in a match. By applying the Poisson distribution to the previous season (2023-24) data, we can calculate the expected number of goals for each team in a given match and use this information to predict the outcome. There is an exception of three clubs( Burnley, Sheffield United, Luton Town) in the previous season data. A simulator is used to simulate matches between the three clubs and the other Premier League clubs. Since those three clubs have been promoted to the Premier League for the next season. Therefore, those three clubs have simulated data and not real-time data.

# Requirements
1. Microsoft Excel.
2. Premier League 2022-23 data.
3. EFL Championship top 3 club's simulated data.

# Notes
* The accuracy of the predictions may vary, and they should be considered as estimates rather than guaranteed results.
* The Poisson distribution assumes the percentage of different scoreline or number of goals scored by a home team or an away team in a match. Other factors such as team form, player injuries, and tactics are not considered in this system.
